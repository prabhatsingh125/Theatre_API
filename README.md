This is the Theatre API which tells about the movieName,ReleaseDate,TicketPrice and it's cast which is yet to be implemented

Technology Used:- 
    The language used in the Project is Java and SpringBoot Framework is used. I have used MongoDB database to fetch the data in the form of JSON and convert it into object using Jackson Library.
    LOMBOK is also used to avoid the boiler Plate.
    Some of the Test cases are also implemented but they are fetching data from MOngoDB which is yet to be improved as the target is to use Mockito framework.
